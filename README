Mediawiki-Blame version 0.0.1

In Mediawiki, it is really easy to see who was responsible for a certain edit.
But what if you want to know who is responsible for a piece of content? That
would require you to go through all revisions manually.

This module does the work for you by using a dump of the revision history and
shows for each line of a Mediawiki page source who edited it last.


INSTALLATION

To install system-wide:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  sudo ./Build install

To install in a private directory:

  perl Build.PL --install_base ~/perl
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Do not forget to add $HOME/perl/lib/perl5 to your @INC, see perldoc perlfaq8
"How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?".


TESTING

Without special preparation, some tests are skipped.

There are some checks provided through Test::Pod::Coverage and
Test::Pod if they can be loaded.

There is also a test through Test::Perl::Critic,
enabled by setting the TEST_AUTHOR env variable.
It is not useful for other people than me, the author.
