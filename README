Mediawiki-Blame version 0.0.3 is Copyright © 2007-2009, Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In Mediawiki, it is really easy to see who was responsible for a certain edit.
But what if you want to know who is responsible for a piece of content? That
would require you to go through all revisions manually.

This module does the work for you by using a dump of the revision history and
shows for each line of a Mediawiki page source who edited it last.


=head1 INSTALLATION

To install system-wide:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

To install in a private directory:

  perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~/perl
  make
  make test
  make install

Do not forget to add F<$HOME/perl/lib/perl5> to your C<@INC>, see
L<perlfaq8/"How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime?">.


=head1 TESTING

Without special preparation, some tests are skipped.

There are some checks provided through L<Test::Pod::Coverage> and
L<Test::Pod> if they can be loaded.

There is also a test through L<Test::Perl::Critic>,
enabled by setting the C<TEST_AUTHOR> env variable.
It is not useful for other people than me, the author.
